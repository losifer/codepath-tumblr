# Tumblr Prototype

This is a prototype for the Tumblr app displaying custom tab bar controls and overlayed view controllers with delayed animations


Time spent: Approximately 11.5 hours development + 1 hours QA and Testing

Optimized for iPhone 5s (portrait)

# Required items:

- [x] Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
- [x] Compose button should modally present the compose screen.

# Optionals and Extras:

- [x] Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
- [x] Login button should show animate the login form over the view controller. (threw in an alert view just for fun and practice)
- [x] Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.
